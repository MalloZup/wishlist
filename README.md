A meta-repo for stuff you'd like clj-commons to take care of

# What to do

If you use a project that's in need of tlc, please file an issue about it, so we can start working on transferring it to clj-commons.

If you'd like to help out maintaining any of the projects maintained by clj-commons, you can file an issue about that too.

If there's stuff you think clj-commons should be doing, but is not, guess what, you may very well file an issue for that.
